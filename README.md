SOWELL - animations
===================

> REPO IS DEPRECATED. 
> Please check out [Trustlab's](https://github.com/medialab/trustlab) versioning [here](https://github.com/medialab/trustlab/tree/master/_animatedsims).

## Animations used in tests for SOWELL, ported from Flash to HTML5.

#### Setup
Each animation lies in its own subdirectory, with the usable result being place in an `output` subfolder.
Inspect the HTML files and respect the code and instructions they provide.

#### About the optional setup
Animations may come with optional `data-attributes` to change content pseudo-dynamically without having to touch the source file.
Refer to README files in each source directories.
